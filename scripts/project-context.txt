Project: Innovator
Type: Nx Workspace Monorepo
Technology Stack: Node.js 22, TypeScript, pnpm

Description:
This is an enterprise-grade monorepo built with Nx that contains multiple projects and packages. The workspace includes:

1. innovator-mvp-frontend: A Nuxt.js-based frontend application with:

   - SPA loading templates

2. innovator-mvp: A backend/infrastructure project with:
   - AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
   - TypeScript-based serverless functions
   - SonarCloud integration for code quality
   - Multiple environment configurations

Architecture:
- Monorepo structure with shared tooling and dependencies
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Code quality gates with ESLint, Prettier, and SonarCloud
- Conventional commits and automated releases
- Docker and CDK deployment strategies

Development Standards:
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Conventional commits for consistent git history
- Automated testing with Vitest
- Husky hooks for pre-commit validation

When writing issues for this project, consider:
- Nx workspace structure and project interdependencies
- Frontend/backend separation and API contracts
- Infrastructure requirements and AWS services
- Multi-environment deployment considerations
- Code quality and testing requirements
